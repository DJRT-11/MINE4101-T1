## Dev Ideas

### Univariate

#### Location
- Bar plot per neighbourhood, organized by number of listings
- Mapped coordinates

#### Price
- Distribution / Box chart?
- Histogram

#### Property + Room Type
- Frequency of types
- Frequency of accommodated people per type

#### Availability
- Joint bar for 30, 60 and 90 days

#### Demand
- Approximate booking seasons per review dates (from reviews.csv)

### Bivariate
- Price correlations: number of listings, availability, amenity score
- Location vs price vs scores: determine the most prolific boroughs
- Best 3 zones, estimate profit for year using calendar availability + availability + review date

### Conclusion: HACKNEY
Factors:
- Not top number of listings, but less availability = more demand, slightly less competition
- High overall score = better reputation of the neighbourhood
- Low amenity score = small investments can make listings stand out

Best neighbourhood to invest: HACKNEY
