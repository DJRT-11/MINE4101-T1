# Final Advice
#### Taking into account all the information displayed in the notebook files, our recommendations for investments in AirBnB listings in London are as follows:

### <u>If investing in existing properties</u>
If the objective is to invest in current listings in order to improve them and increase their popularity while taking advantage of the existing demand, our suggestion is to invest in **<u>Camden</u>**.
#### Why Camden?
- Per Figure 7 (01 - Initial Data Understanding), Camden has the second highest number of reviews (i.e. number of times guests stayed), meaning that there is a demand in the market for properties in Camden.
- Per Figure 9 (01 - Initial Data Understanding), listings in Camden have an average 'amenity score' among other boroughs, and a relatively small investment in improving this score for existing properties could justify an increase in listing prices (correlation represented in Figure 11) that potential guests will be willing to pay.
- Per Figure 12 (02 - Analysis Strategy), Camnden has the third highest average profit, meaning that it generates high value per guest stay.

### <u>If investing in new properties</u>
If the objective is to invest in the creation of new listings in order to cover the demand in a certain neighbourhood, our suggestion is to invest in **<u>Hackney</u>**.
#### Why Hackney?
- Per Figure 6 (01 - Initial Data Understanding), Hackney has the lowest availability for the next 30, 60, and 90 days among the top 5 boroughs, while having the third highest number of listings. In other words, there is a sligh gap in offer compared to other top boroughs.
- Per Figure 8 (01 - Initial Data Understanding), listings in Hackney have a high average overall score. This means the borough itself has a nice reputation, which can help new listings stand out from similar ones in other boroughs.
- Per Figure 9 (01 - Initial Data Understanding), listings in Hackney have an 'amenity score' below the average. This is a great opportunity, since new listings covering most of the top-listed amenities will stand out from the current offer.
- Per Figure 12 (02 - Analysis Strategy), Hackney does not have a high average profit. However, since the listings in Hackney have a low average 'amenity score' (Figure 9) and this score is highly correlated to the listing price (Figure 11), guests may be willing to pay a higher price for new listings in Hackey that do have better amenities.
